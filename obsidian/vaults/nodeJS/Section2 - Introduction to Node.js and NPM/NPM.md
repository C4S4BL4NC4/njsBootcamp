Package manager used to install open-source library from  the NPM repository.


#### Initializing the folder:

Always start with `npm init` to generate the necessary files to work with npm.

#### To install a package:

`npm i packageName`

==Keep in mind that the best practice is to install a library per folder rather that a global install of the library.  ==
Global installation of a library is done with the flag 
`--global`.



#### Types of libraries to install:

Regular dependencies e.g. *slugify* and developer dependencies that is installed with the flag at the end of the install command `--save-dev` such as *nodemon*.
