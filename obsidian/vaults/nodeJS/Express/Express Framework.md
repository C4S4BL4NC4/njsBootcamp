#ExpressJS is a minimal #NodeJS framework, a higher level of abstraction.
It contains a very robust set of features: complex, routing, easier handling of requests and responses, middle-ware, server-side rendering, etc. Express also allows for rapid development of #NodeJS applications: we don't have to re-invent the wheel, as well as  making it easier to organize  our application into the #MVC architecture.
