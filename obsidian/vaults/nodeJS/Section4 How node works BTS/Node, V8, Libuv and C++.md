## Node.js = V8 + libuv

### Libuv:

A open-source C++ library with strong focus on #Asyncio this layer gives access to #fs, #networking ,and more.

It also implements important features of #NodeJS such as #eventLoop and #threadpool

Functions of #V8 and #libuv are accessed by #NodeJS and provide a layer of abstraction to interact with these using #JavaScript

#NodeJS also relies on other libraries such as:
-  #http-parser: for parsing http.
-  #c-ares: for DNS requests and more.
- #OpenSSL: for Cryptography.
- #zlib: for file compression.
